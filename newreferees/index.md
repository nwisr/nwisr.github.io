We welcome new individuals to join our association. Since most of the games we oversee are for adults, we require all referees to be at least 17 years old. Many of our referees began their journey as USSF-registered referees, having completed the USSF training course and officiated several outdoor games before joining us. While this background is highly recommended, we have also seen successful referees who have experience playing indoor or futsal soccer. If you are an experienced outdoor referee and have played indoor soccer, we would love to have you on our team. However, you do not need to meet both of these criteria to join. As long as you are over 17 years old and eager to learn about indoor and futsal soccer, you are welcome to become a member of our association.


**1. Here are the steps to become a part of our association.** 

They must be done in the order noted.You must create a Payment Center Account on Horizon web ref – the instructions are here

To set up an account, there is a one-time fee that you must pay. As long as you complete at least one paid game per year through HorizonWebRef, your payment center account will remain active, and you won’t incur any additional fees. Next, you’ll need to add a bank account to your HorizonWebRef profile. This process will require your bank's name and your online login credentials, including your login and password. Once you provide this information, your account will be instantly connected. Please note that I cannot withdraw any money from your account. For more information on adding a bank account, please refer to the instructions provided.

It’s important to take care of this matter to receive payment for any game. I apologize for the transaction fee, but I am covering all other fees associated with this website, except for the $1.10 transaction fee for each payment made. I hope you understand this situation. It's reasonable. You will have all your payment records in one place for accounting and tax information as needed. As soon as possible, set up your payment center account on HorizonWebRef.

**2. How to Register for and use a Horizon Web Ref Account**

To use the assignment website Horizon Web Ref, please follow the instructions below. This platform is where you will receive your assignments once you have completed your training, as well as access your training assignments.

1. Send an email to toservethegame@gmail.com to request being added to the system. After your request is processed, you will receive an email from Horizon Web Ref inviting you to join. Please ensure you use an email address that you check at least daily. 2. Each indoor or futsal facility is treated as a separate league within Horizon Web Ref. When you log in to Horizon Web Ref for the first time, the system will guide you through setting up your profile, including all the required information. By default, you will be available to work at all the facilities we serve.

**3.  As an Independent Contractor.**

You can sign up for as many or as few facilities as you wish. However, the more facilities you are willing to work in, the more likely you are to get assigned to games. If you only sign up for one facility that has limited availability, you may not be assigned to many (or any) games. To manage your preferences, you can use the availability calendar to block specific venues or leagues where you do not wish to work. If you are only certified in Futsal, you will only be assigned to facilities that offer Futsal. Similarly, if you are only certified in Indoor, you will be assigned to facilities that provide Indoor play. Being certified in both formats significantly increases your chances of being assigned to more games.

**4.Submit your availabilities**

You can submit your availability for refereeing as far in advance as you like; however, most referees typically provide their availability for the next few weeks or months. It’s important to keep your availabilities updated regularly. Our referee scheduling runs from Monday to Sunday, and the schedule is usually completed a few weeks in advance. The more hours or days you are available, the more likely you are to receive assignments for games.

**5. Register to use the assigning website.**	

Horizon web Ref following the directions below – not only will this be where you will get your assignments once you are fully trained this is also where you will get your training assignments. See instructions below.

**6.Dress Code:**

We have the most permissive uniform code of any referee association, yet some people still feel the need to operate outside of it. How are you being perceived in the workplace? This is crucial because people form their judgments of us based on their observations. Once we are viewed in a negative light, everything we do from that point onward will be magnified or questioned. In summary, once someone is perceived negatively, even the smallest actions can be blown out of proportion.

That, in a nutshell, is it. Once you are perceived negatively, every little thing becomes bigger.

**7.NWISR Uniform Policy.**

1. Commercially manufactured referee shirt of any brand in any color and any sleeve length. In generally good repair (no holes, not severely faded, etc.) You should always have two or three different colors with you in case you conflict with teams.

2. Shorts or “Sweat” pants—should be solid black or navy blue with little or no decoration or trim of other colors. Can be commercially manufactured referee shorts or pants, but does not need to be.

3. Black socks, or black with white trim, again, can be but do not need to be actual referee socks.

4. Black shoes, of any brand, should be shoes that you would allow a player to play in (e.g. not cleats) 5.Logos are fine.
6.NWISR Badge.
7. Whistle(s) & lanyard
8. Red, Yellow, & Blue cards – you MUST have a blue card before doing any indoor game.

**8. Do on-field training with a senior referee.** 

Most of our on-field training is conducted using headsets. When you train with a senior referee or trainer, you do not receive payment. Referees with extensive outdoor experience typically require only a few days or nights of training for each type of game. However, some referees need multiple sessions with senior referees before they are recommended for an assignment. You must obtain a recommendation from at least one senior referee or trainer for each type of game (indoor or Futsal) before you can progress to the next step.

**9. Once you are recommended for an assignment you will be scheduled to do games on your own,** 

**10. Now you are a full-fledged referee for NWISR and a member of our association.** 

You will use Horizon Web Ref to signal your availability for games and to accept assignments. Once you accept an assignment you are expected to complete those games.

**11. Confirm assignments**

Horizon Web Ref will notify you (via email/text or both depending on your preferences) when you have been assigned to a game or set of games, you generally have 24 hours to accept or decline the games. You should confirm all games as soon as possible; they are not assigned to you until you have confirmed them. 

**12. Login regularly**

You should regularly check the Northwest Indoor Soccer Referees website for updates. Important notices such as weather-related facility closures will be posted on the top of the home page. You can find forms, rules, and other information on the site. You should also use the site as a pathway to accessing your Horizon Web Ref account.

It is your responsibility to monitor your Horizon Web Ref account for assignments. Ideally, you should log in daily to check for any changes or last-minute assignments. Schedules change often and you may have games added or removed from your schedule. I typically reach out via phone if any changes happen within a few hours of game time, but that is not guaranteed and I will always expect you to check online before going to a facility.

You are strongly encouraged to turn on the Text notification feature of Horizon Web Ref to keep notified of changes to your schedule as much as possible.

**13.Facility Information:**

The chart below lists each facility that we service and the payments, per team and per game, should be self-explanatory. The per hour is how much you make for each hour you are at the facility (not including the time before your first or after your last game). That is, the amount you make per hour for your block of games, including halftime and between games. The per-minute fee is how much you make at that facility for each minute of game time, this calculation does not include halftime or between games, but only how much you make for the minutes of game time. These fees are the same for youth games and adult games, daytime games, and night time games.

|Facility|Per team fee|Per game fee|Per hour fee|Per minute fee|
