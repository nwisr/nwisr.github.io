**Making Payments to become a Referee**

The first thing that you need to do, is to Pay your Class and Registration Fees, before you do any thing else.
To do this, simply go to NWISR.com, on the black navigation bar at the top of the screen click on Referees,
there you will see 4 green boxes, go to Make Payment (Pay for registration and recertification) and select what you want to do.

**Register for a Horizon Web Ref Account**

At the class you will give the instructor your email address and you will then receive an email from Horizon Web Ref inviting you to join, you must do this in order to get games. 

**Set Up Your Horizon Web Ref Account**

Each indoor or futsal facility is considered a separate league within Horizon Web Ref. When you login to Horizon Web Ref for the first time the system will walk you through setting up your profile, including all required items. By default, you are available to work at all of the facilities we service.

As an Independent Contractor, you can sign up for as many or as few facilities as you wish, but the more you are willing to work in, the more likely you are to get games. If you only sign up for one facility, and that facility only has one floor, and has games on only a few nights a week, you are not likely to be assigned to many (or any) games at that facility.
You can go to the availability calendar and click on Block venues or block leagues to select any facilities where you don’t want to work.  

**Submit your availabilities**

Again, from the availability calendar  You may submit your availabilities as far in the future as you wish, but most referees provide availabilities for the next few weeks. You will need to keep your availabilities updated regularly. Our referee week is Monday through Sunday with the schedule completed usually a few weeks in advance.The more hours/days you can make yourself available the more likely you are to get (more) games.
Most referees start with youth games, almost all of the youth games are Saturday and Sunday during the day. Weeknight games (and most weekend night games) are adult games, very few new referees are ready for those, and they are almost always covered by experienced indoor/futsal referees – so if you do not make yourself available for Saturday and Sunday during the day you are unlikely to get any games.

**Confirm assignments**

Horizon Web Ref will notify you (via email/text or both depending on your preferences) when you have been assigned to a game or set of games, you generally have 48 hours to accept or decline the games. You should confirm all games as soon as possible, they are not actually assigned to you until you have confirmed them.

**Login regularly**

You should regularly check the Northwest Indoor Soccer Referees website for updates. Important notices such as weather related facility closures will be posted on the top of the home page. You can find forms, rules, and other information on the site. You should also use the site as a pathway to accessing your Horizon Web Ref account.

It is your responsibility to monitor your Horizon Web Ref account for assignments. Ideally, you should login daily to check for any changes or last minute assignments. Schedules change often and you may have games added or removed from your schedule. I typically reach out via phone if there are any changes that happen within a few hours of game time, but that is not guaranteed and I will always expect you to check online before going to a facility.

# Facility Information

The chart below lists each facility that we service and the payments, the per team and per game should be self-explanatory. The per hour is how much you make for each hour you are at the facility (not including time before your first or after your last game). That is, the amount you make per hour for your block of games, including halftime and between games. The per minute fee is how much you make at that facility for each minute of game time, this calculation does not include halftime or between games, but only how much you make for the minutes of game time. These fees are the same for youth games and adult games, daytime games and nighttime games.
