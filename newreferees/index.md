# Your Journey to Becoming a NWISR Referee

This document describes each of the steps you must take to become a NWISR referee. Although there are multiple steps in the process, it is not difficult and you may find being referee to be a very rewarding pastime.

## Register to attend a NWISR class

On the home page of the [Northwest Indoor Referees](https://nwisr.com/) website, click onto the **Register for Referee Classes** button. Complete the entire form, including the class date that you would like to attend.

Next, select the [Make Payment](https://nwisr.com/payment/) button and complete the entire payment process. When paying, make sure to choose either Indoor training, Futsal training, or both indoor and futsal training. This payment includes training and certification for your first year.

You must pay via credit card in advance for the class you wish to attend. Payments will not be accepted at the class location and you will not be permitted to attend if you have not paid.

## Complete on-field training

Now that you have registered and attended class, it’s now time to complete on-field training. The best way to schedule is to call Eric between the hours of 8AM and 4PM at 503-662-8182. You may also email eric@toservethegame.com, but that is much less efficient.

If you wish to work both Indoor and Futsal games (and you have paid for both), you will need to schedule training for each. These can be done as soon as you can schedule them, or you can wait a few weeks. You will not be allowed to referee on your own until you have completed on-field training with a senior referee (often Eric).

## Register for a Sportzing account

NOTE: We have changed from SportZing to Horizon. The following information is out-of-date. Please sign up on Horizon.

You need to [register for a personal Sportzing account](https://sportzing.com/sz/register/tstg). You may click the previous link, or go to the [NWISR home page](https://nwisr.com/) and click on the Sportzing tab.

Once registered, you will soon get your account verification email. Click onto the link in that email and enter your authorization code.

It is important that you never create more than one Sportzing account or you may miss assignments because they were made across multiple accounts. If you forget your login information, use the forgot password feature and DO NOT create another account.

## Sign up for leagues (indoor facilities)

NOTE: We have changed from SportZing to Horizon. The following information is out-of-date.

Each indoor or futsal facility is considered a separate league within Sportzing. When you login to Sportzing for the first time, you will not be a member of any leagues. The first thing you should do is join the facilities (leagues) you want to work at using the Sportzing website.

As an Independent Contractor, you can sign up for as many or as few facilities as you wish, but the more you are willing to work in, the more likely you are to get games. If you only sign up for one facility, and that facility only has one floor, and has games on only a few nights a week, you are not likely to be assigned to many (or any) games at that facility.

To sign up for leagues on Sportzing, you will need to login and then go to Sportzing version 1. Do this by clicking the green star-like logo in the top left of the screen and selecting **Go to Version 1** from the menu. Next, click on **Referees** on the left and then **My Leagues**. If you click on the league name, a bit of information about that league will be shown. Select the leagues you wish to join by clicking the blue plus (+) symbol.

## Submit your availabilities

NOTE: We have changed from SportZing to Horizon. The following information is out-of-date.

Once you have joined the leagues you wish to work in, the next step is to choose when you are available to be assigned. You may submit your availabilities as far in the future as you wish, but most referees provide availabilities for the next few weeks. You will need to keep your availabilities updated regularly. Our referee week is Monday through Sunday with the schedule completed on the Friday before. You must have your availability entered by Wednesday of each week. The more hours/days you can make yourself available the more likely you are to get (more) games.

Most referees start with youth games, almost all of the youth games are Saturday and Sunday during the day. Weeknight games (and most weekend night games) are adult games, very few new referees are ready for those, and they are almost always covered by experienced indoor/futsal referees – so if you do not make yourself available for Saturday and Sunday during the day you are unlikely to get any games.

The availability calendars in Sportzing versions 1 and version 2 are slightly different. Either will work, but most people prefer the one in version 2. I recommend switching back to version 2 in order to enter your availabilities. Do this by clicking the orange **Version 2** tab at the top of the page. If you see the green star-like logo at the top left, you are already on version 2.

Click on the **Availabilities** tab and select the days you are available during the month. Slide the start and end times on the bottom slider to be the time ranges you are available on those days. Then click onto the **Create Availabilities** button. You may repeat this as many times as you wish with different time ranges for various days. You can change to other months and do the same.

## Confirm assignments

NOTE: We have changed from SportZing to Horizon. The following information is out-of-date.

Login to Sportzing and click on the **Assignments** tab within version 2. Any assignments that have been given to you will show up in the list. You may *Accept* or *Decline* these assignments. You may also be able to *Turn back* assignments that are further out. If you have indicated you are available, I am expecting that you will accept your games. If you cannot for some reason, please make sure to explain why you are unable. I tend to stop assigning games to people who repeatedly decline or turn back games.

## Login regularly

NOTE: We have changed from SportZing to Horizon. The following information is out-of-date.

You should regularly check the [Northwest Indoor Soccer Referees](https://nwisr.com/) website for updates. Important notices such as weather related facility closures will be posted on the top of the home page. You can find forms, rules, and other information on the site. You should also use the site as a pathway to accessing your Sportzing account.

It is your responsibility to monitor your Sportzing account for assignments. Ideally, you should login daily to check for any changes or last minute assignments. Schedules change often and you may have games added or removed from your schedule. I typically reach out via phone if there are any changes that happen within a few hours of game time, but that is not guaranteed and I will always expect you to check online before going to a facility.

# Facility Information

The chart below lists each facility that we service and the payments, the per team and per game should be self-explanatory. The per hour is how much you make for each hour you are at the facility (not including time before your first or after your last game). That is, the amount you make per hour for your block of games, including halftime and between games. The per minute fee is how much you make at that facility for each minute of game time, this calculation does not include halftime or between games, but only how much you make for the minutes of game time. These fees are the same for youth games and adult games, daytime games and nighttime games.

|Facility|Per team fee|Per game fee|Per hour fee|Per minute fee|
|:-------|-----------:|-----------:|-----------:|-------------:|
|Beaverton Indoor Soccer|$10|$20|$24.00|$0.45|
|Mittleman Jewish CC|$10|$20|$24.00|$0.45|
