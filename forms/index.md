About Eric

Eric Beck has been involved in the soccer arena for over 50 years. In 2010 he was inducted into the USASA National Soccer Hall-of-Fame and was previously honored as a member of the USASA Region IV (West) Hall-of-Fame.

Eric Beck was born in Long Eaton, England in 1949 the youngest of 14 children. Following high school he joined the English Army. One of his later assignments was as part of the English Army Basketball team which embarked on a tour in North Africa. They were victorious in each game. Eric and his team wanted to explore their love for the sport. A U.S. Aircraft carrier was in port at Tobruk Libya and they decided to arrange a game. After 6 years in the Army and at the age of 25, Eric moved to America residing in Portland, Oregon. He quickly met his wife Beverly with whom he recently celebrated his 36th wedding anniversary.  He has two daughters, Rachel and  Alissa, and a son Kyle. He has been blessed with 7 grandchildren. Rachel, the mother of Laura, Hannah, and Jake and Alissa with Olivia, Gavin, Liam and Amelia. In addition to Eric’s love of for his family and soccer, he finds much pleasure in singing. He has played at various local pubs and parties in addition to performing with his daughter Alissa in Krayon Kids, a children’s Musical Theater Company.  Eric has utilized his many gifts and recorded the current the theme song of the Portland Timbers professional soccer team. The record “Green is the Color” has enjoyed strong regional sales and even some airplay.

Eric started his soccer career at the age of 4 years old but was forced to quit playing due to knee problems at the age of 29. Following a second back surgery, he was told “you should never run again”. Eric continued to follow his passion, redoubling his efforts and became a national referee. He has refereed at the highest levels available and has gradually transitioned to more administrative and assigning duties. He performs these tasks for various youth and adult leagues, tournaments and indoor/outdoor centers.

Frequently Asked Questions



Referees

How do I deal with angry players?
One of the most difficult things for beginning referees (and for any referee, for that matter) is learning how to handle criticism and angry players, and just how much of it to “take.”

There are always going to be players who disagree with a call you make, or don’t make. Sometimes, they’ll voice a quick opinion, or vent for a moment, and you should be able to handle an objection, even if it’s strenuously made, even if it might include a bit of profanity, as long as it’s brief. However, there are some players who will continue to yell/scream/object with you, and will continue to berate you. You should not let these players continue to harp at you. It’s your responsibility to yourself, the other players, and the playing environment of the game to stop these actions and objections from continuing.

In most cases, a simple, quick, and direct statement like (“That’s enough”; “I don’t want to hear any more from you”; “We’re done”, etc), or use body language that make it clear that you’re not inviting a conversation because at this point you’re beyond that, As soon as you’re done, try to move physically away from the player and make it very clear that he/she is not to follow this should be sufficient to take care of the situation. Don’t make your statement a threat to the player; i.e. “If you don’t shut up, I’m going to card you”, because now you’re issuing a challenge. Most players are experienced enough (and sane enough human beings) that they’ll get the picture, and get back to playing.

That being said, there are some who still lack the maturity to restrain themselves, or else they’ll blow up immediately and go WAY over the line with regard to how they conduct themselves. Be proactive here, and issue those players an administrative blue card. When you do so, don’t confront the player, don’t say anything to them (such as “I warned you if….:”), and keep your composure so that you don’t appear to be vindictive. Blow your whistle, and calmly show the player the blue card from a reasonable distance, not in the player’s face. Be businesslike, but at the same time almost nonchalant, so that the air you silently and non-verbally reflect to the other players is that of “You know, I don’t want to do this, but he/she wouldn’t drop it, and left me no other choice.” Don’t let your face show anger toward the player, but that of resignation that someone was immature enough to cause the awarding of the blue card to happen.

Be sure to remind the carded player’s teammates that the administrative blue is a full two-minute penalty for the player in question, once a goal is scored the power play is over, but the player who was carded cannot return until the full two minutes has passed. Peer pressure can be a wonderful ally for you in this situation. You’ll be surprised how often the out-of-control player’s teammates can’t stand his or her behavior either, and will support your actions. They don’t want out-of-control people” spoiling their playing experience, either. One blue card should take care of the player who can’t control himself–but be prepared to take further action if needed, and most of all, keep your cool.


Bad Weather Conditions

Weather Conditions:

 1).    Due to the weather conditions all referees are strongly advised to call the Facility that they are assigned to referee in TWO hours before there first game of the day to find out if the facility is open or closed.
Assignment Changes:
2).    Also at this time of year, due to the large increase of games in the facilities that we service, there are constant changes made to the schedules, so calling the facility that you are schedule to work TWO hours before, to check and make sure that your scheduled block is still correct,  would be the best thing to do to avoid wasting your time.

Assignor Policy for working games on SportZing


Some things continue to come up, many of them have been going on for years, some are just now showing up on the assigning sites (primary SportZing), some things get referees into trouble with the leagues/tournaments/Indoor Centers and some get referees in trouble with the assignor (in this case, me) and some things referees do get the assignor in trouble with the league which makes the assignor very unhappy.

Therefore, I am putting the following polices in writing, I do not believe anything is changing, I just want to make sure it is spelled out so that we have no misunderstanding.

I am not qualified to talk much about independent contractor law, but I do know a little bit:

With respect to the leagues, I (the assignor) am an independent contractor – that means that the league gives me certain guidelines (such as referees must be registered with USSF) and within those guideline I preform the job using my training and experience. The league “hires” me, and within the framework of independent contractor law they “supervise” me.

You as a referee are also an independent contractor, when you go onto SportZing  and request a game you are accepting the terms & conditions of that game (guidelines) and within those guideline you preform the job using your training and experience I “hire” you, and within the framework of independent contractor law I “supervise” you.

If you want to know more:

http://www.oregonadultsoccer.com/PDF%20others/Referee%20and%20assignor%20information%20policy.pdf

Which is the official policy of the Oregon Adult Soccer Association but also applies to pretty much any soccer. I encourage you to read it.

Quoting from that policy: “how the independent contractors (both assignor and referees) go about their job is governed by their training and experience, including the current USSF referee and assignor code of ethics they must agree to each year when they re-register with USSF.”

Things that get referees in trouble with leagues tend to be either on the field or something to do with the referee report (like turning it in late, or not at all). If a league tells me as an assignor to not use you on their games, that’s it. You are not going to be assigned to games for that league, either for a period of time or indefinitely. The league may also refer the referee to the Referee Professionalism subcommittee of the Oregon Referee Committee, which has the ability to penalize you, up to an including suspending you from all affiliated soccer (very rare).

The list of things that get the referee into trouble with the assignor (me) is longer here are some of them:

Trying to “game” the system –

1.            Over Requesting games -some referees request far more games than they could possible do, this blocks other referees from getting the games and depending on when the games get turned back creates problems to filling them.

Do not request more games than you plan on doing – period.  If you do this you will be blocked from SportZing (meaning not assigned to any games that I am the assignor of).

2.            Confirming/Not confirming games – some referees seem to wait until the last minute to confirm a game, making the assignor think that you are waiting to see if something better comes along, that can put me in a spot if I have to fill a position at the last minute. Also, it is not helpful to continually confirm games and then turn them back at the last minute. If you do this you will be blocked from SportZing.

3.            Asking another referee (or worse yet, a non-referee) to fill in for you. Don’t do this EVER. If you do this you will be blocked from SportZing.

The bottom line – make yourself available only for those days/times that you can reasonably expect to actually do the game, confirm only those games that you intend to referee. Look, I understand that sometimes things come up, occasionally. Call, email – leave messages for me if I do not answer. I understand you may think that having your buddy fill in is helping me out. It is not. Please refer to both the OASA policy and the USSF Code of Ethics.

Once in a while turning back a game late (say within 72 hours of the game) or being a no show (with good excuse)is understandable. If it happens too much you will be blocked from SportZing.

To repeat from above, I “work” as an independent contractor for several leagues, tournaments and indoor centers – I am responsible for keeping them happy. You “work” as an independent contractor for me – you are responsible for keeping me happy. If a league has a problem with you, the communication should be from them to me and then from me to you. If you have a problem with a league, or something that you believe should be brought to their attention, that should be communicated to me. If a league, tournament, or center official (President, director, manager, or whatever other title they may have) has a polite, reasonable request, you should do your best to honor it – but if they try to tell you anything that violates OASA policy, the USSF Code of Ethics, or common sense you should politely tell them to contact me.

You should also know that the number of assignors in Oregon is rather small, and the number of assignors in the Portland area who assignor a lot of games is two, we do speak to each other and eventually if you continue to do the same things it will catch up to you, if another assignor tells me that you have, for instance, turned back a lot of games, I may not block you, but you will be watched more closely.

Follow the USSF Code of Ethics, especially the first 3 items, be respectful of your assignor, and use common sense and you will never have a problem.




The Six Key Factors

Ladies and Gentlemen:

When you referee you are representing me, and the Indoor facility that you have been assigned to work in.

In an attempt to help you to understand why you might or might not get as many games as you would like, I have provided you with the six criteria that I use to make these weekly decisions.

1) Ability –– Are you capable of handling a match at a given level? Your experience will quite often be a key factor here.

2) Availability –– I give priority for weekday shifts to those people who are available on weekends.

3) Reliability –– What is your track record? Are you always on time? Do you ever forget to show up? If I cannot count on you then don’t expect too many assignments.

4) Loyalty –– I understand that most referees work various leagues throughout the year, but if indoor is a low priority for you, then you will be a lower priority to me.

5) Acceptability – How both the players and facility management perceive your ability must be a consideration here. Do you have a good rapport with the players? Are you aware that each facility’s management, for any of a number of reasons, has asked me not to schedule certain referees? This makes it more difficult to give you games as a result.

6) Seniority – How long have you been refereeing Indoor, certain referees have been doing games in certain facilities for many years, experience goes a long way.

The bottom line is this –– there are many factors that go into assigning games each week. I suggest you think about why you might not be getting the number of assignments you might like before bothering me with your complaints. The answer probably lays somewhere in those six factors listed above.

All referees are required to check in with the facility 10 to 15 minutes before there first game, This comes under Reliability above.

                              Referee Assigning and Management

MetroPDX Soccer, LLC provides referee assigning and management services to soccer and futsal leagues, tournaments, and facilities.

More details coming soon…




NWISR

How to become a referee
MetroPDX only works with certified referees. In order to be assigned indoor or futsal games, you must have a Northwest Indoor certification. For most outdoor youth and adult games, you will need USSF certification.

In addition, you will need to provide a W-9 form and be a member of SportZing. In SportZing, you will have to join all leagues that you want to work in.

Summary:

Obtain USSF certification and/or NW Indoor certification
Submit W-9 form
Submit the Metro PDX Contract

How to receive assignments
Before you will receive any assignments, you must have completed all steps in How to become a referee above. You must also join all leagues and tournaments where you want assignments. Lastly, you must regularly submit your available dates. Games in most leagues are assigned based on availabilities.

Some leagues and tournaments are open for self-assigning games. Sometimes, all games will be self-assignable, while other times no games are self-assignable unless someone has declined or turned back an assignment. These returned games may be found and self-assigned in Find Open Games on SportZing.

Join Leagues on SportZing. Go to My Leagues in Version 1 and request to join leagues.
Submit your Availabilities on SportZing. Go to Availabilities in Version 2 to submit availabilities.
Regularly check SportZing for games that are assigned to you. Go to Assignments in Version 2.
Accept or Decline games that are assigned to you. Go to Assignments in Version 2.
Search for Open Games on SportZing. Go to Open Games in Version 1.
How to get paid
To get paid, you must show up for your assignment on time and submit a game report within 48 hours after the game has completed. All referees, including assistant referees, must submit game reports. Game reports should be submitted via SportZing in the Assignments tab of Version 2. This will ensure that your game records are complete and you get PAID for your games, as payroll is completed using the reports submitted to SportZing.

However, not all leagues require game reports to be submitted. If a game report is required, it will show up in the Assignments tab on SportZing. In the case of most indoor and fustal games, you will be paid at the field before the game starts. Always check to make sure if a game report is required or not, as submitting your report late will incur late fees and delayed payment.

Unlike other referee assignors, MetroPDX has chosen to not charge referee fees. In our opinion, these are unfair business practices.  You deserve to retain the entire game fee through your hard work and professionalism.

NWISR Policies



     NorthWest Indoor Soccer Referees

Policies regarding referee complaints, relations with facility staff and related areas

These policies come about as the result of several years of feedback across several facilities, examples given are generic in nature and any resemblance to a given situation at a certain facility or a certain referee only serves to reinforce the fact that they are common to many referees and at virtually every facility.

We all (players, coaches, referees, facility staff, assignors, assessors, trainers, etc.) want the best possible referee on each game.

Beginning now the following policies apply:

When any customer (player, coach, parent, spectator, etc.) approaches facility staff to complain or compliment any referee performance,  the customer should be reminded that referees are independent contractors and not under facility control and they should be given our handout regarding referee feedback (attached) and directed to the website www.NWISR.com as described on the handout.


  Facility staff should refrain from ANY comment regarding referee performance. Some facility staff also play at their facility and some also referee.  Any staff person who EVER hears any NWISR referee comment on the performance of any fellow referee in violation of our code of conduct(attached) and specifically in violation of sections 5, 6, and/or 7 which read:


“(5.) I do hereby acknowledge my fellow referees’ total authority over any matches over which they are duly assigned to officiate, and I pledge that I will never interfere with the carrying out of their prescribed duties, before, during, or after a match.

(6.) I understand that any criticism of fellow referees should be limited to constructive criticism in quiet, private referee-to-referee discussions, and then never within hearing distance of players, coaches, staff, or spectators.

(7.) I also acknowledge that if I am also a staff member, coach, player, or spectator, that my conduct towards, and my respect for, my fellow referee doing my game is more closely noticed by all concerned. I will, therefore, strive to set a very high standard of personal conduct under these circumstances to serve as an example to all.”



Should ask the referee to refrain and if the referee does not refrain from commenting on a fellow referees performance, staff should notify NWISR. Certain facilities also hold all of their staff (including those that are not also referees) to the same code of conduct toward referees and this policy is strongly encouraged. In addition, certain facilities have adopted the policy that any staff person who violates this policy while playing in the facility are subject to suspension as a player, and any staff person who receives a red card is subject to an automatic doubling of the suspension. In those facilities where NWISR handles disciple we will follow this guideline and all facilities are encouraged to also do so.



Referees are Independent Contractors – All facilities should make sure all staff are aware of this and what it means. One key to the relationship of referees as Independent Contractors is that facilities, beyond their house rules, must refrain from giving referees instructions regarding how to call a game; referees retain the right to control games without interference using their training and experience – to a large extent this also applies to NWISR. See below for our section on referee training and experience.
Referee Training & Experience

You should know that refereeing soccer is a highly specialized and trained profession, even the most advanced and knowledgeable players, coaches and fans generally have less understanding of the rules/laws/policies than the least experienced beginning referee.

For the most part, we all started out as players, playing for many years – and like you, often thinking we knew the rules better than most of the referees doing our games, this is particularly true of the players who chose to become referees, but then we took the training and learned that the referees did actually study and understand the laws and rules better than we did…

To referee outdoor soccer (the usual beginning step) referees must:

Complete the USSF Training course -18 hours: 12 hours of class-room time, approximately 4-6 hours “on-line” study plus an additional 2 hours field session (see below). Written test upon completion. 100 questions (80% correct to pass)

Field Training:

2 hours done outside on a soccer field. Participants practice movement during play, signals of the referee and Assistant Referee, free kick positioning (direct, indirect, kick-offs, penalty kicks), the pre-game conference, use of the whistle, etc.

That’s before they referee a single game – which is where the real learning starts. In addition they must pay for the course, buy several referee jerseys and other equipment, these are dedicated individuals. Keep in mind, almost all people who decide to take the 18 hour training course are already experienced players/coaches/fans and they all think they understand the laws of the game – 18 course hours later they almost invariably find out that they really did not.

Beyond that, referees must undergo continuing education each year, and if they wish to advance even more in-service training and testing.

In order to officiate indoor/futsal and become NW Indoor certified (required in order to be assigned at this facility) they must attend a 2.5 hour training, this course covers the rules of indoor and Futsal, man-management and communication. Following this class they can request to be assigned with one of our senior referees to give them on the field training – depending upon the background of the referee and the feedback from the trainer, they may quickly progress to actually doing games with a senior referee observing them, or they may spend several nights observing the senior referees, following this on-field training they are ready to referee on their own.

They also undergo continuing education each year in order to recertify.

So, each and every referee has at a minimum, approximately THIRTY HOURS of training (most have also officiated dozens, if not hundreds of outdoor games) prior to referring their first indoor game solo – and yet every player on the field thinks they understand the rules better than the referee.

At the average amateur soccer game the referee crew members are the only neutral parties present because the teams and spectators are all interested parties. Therefore when the referee reports misconduct on their game report, it is generally taken as fact unless and until it is proven otherwise (usually this means the referee recants statements made on the report). Staff should understand that anything said by a participant who is an interested party (including staff members playing in the game or with close friends playing in the game) should be taken for what it is – a report for a biased source, which is not to say it is incorrect, only that it IS biased. Again, facility staff involvement should ONLY be to give the information needed for the person to file a written report with www.NWISR.com. so we can properly follow up.

We often receive complaints about a referee through facility staff, saying things like:

“The referee didn’t do a good job” “The referee lost control of the game”  “The players didn’t like the referee”

It is best to keep in mind, that unless a staff member with no interest in the game happens to be watching, the referee is the ONLY person who is not emotionally invested in the game. Player’s emotions are high, especially if something happens that they feel the need to complain about, this doesn’t mean that the referee didn’t miss a call, just that the player(s) never view the situation impartially, and the referee usually does.

One thing to focus on is the outcome of the game.

We have an old saying in refereeing: Always listen to complaints from the winning team, and compliments from the losing team. Read that again, think about it.

That said, when we get ANY complaint from any team, or any player, we try to determine what is going on, we often speak to the person complaining and more often than not, when we ask them about their specific criticisms of the referee what they describe displays their misunderstanding of the rules, the other thing that frequently happens is they will tell us that the referee “didn’t control the game”, when pressed on what they mean it will often come down to something like the referee didn’t call a foul(or two) that they wanted called. We also speak to the referee, sometimes they know exactly what happened and they (using their training and experience) have a different perspective than the emotionally involved player. Sometimes they have no idea what they (did or did not) miss. Indoor/Futsal is fast, sometimes with lots of large bodies in a small space, nobody can possibly see everything, referees miss calls, but much more often than not they are correct in their application of the rules and the player(s) are wrong.

We also often speak with the team managers involved in situations, such as red cards or a referee is alleged to have “lost control” or a player has filed out a referee evaluation – often the manager is not even aware, and did not have a problem with the referee, or might have some small complaints, but does not have any major problems with the referee. In other words, a player got emotionally involved in something, enough that they were compelled to report it, but when the player, or their manager, or the other team are asked about what really happened in the game, the story changes and in fact either the referee really wasn’t that bad, or the player realizes that they didn’t really understand the rule and the referee really did. This is especially true given a couple days of reflection.

All staff at the facility hear is the emotional player ranting when they are emotional – again, the way for staff to handle it is to NOT comment on the referee at all and to make sure the player knows that the ONLY type of complainant that will receive any attention is by going through the formal process of going to the website www.NWISR.com. and filing a complete, thoughtful referee evaluation. Verbal reports from any player, staff, coach, spectator, etc. will not be considered. Part of that is we are reworking the referee evaluation form and providing greater instructions so that players can give us useful feedback (attached).

We would add that in our many years of listening to player complaints and following up on them, they are rarely what they first seem.

If we get multiple complaints about a referee, especially repeated complaints about the same thing, particularly spanning multiple facilities, we will follow up with the referee and often do a bit of on-field training with them; again, this is rare – because referees in general, do a very good job.

Some examples that illustrate the difference between players understanding and referees:

A referee had major problems with a team the first time they refereed them, red cards, dissent, etc. The team complained to staff about the bad referee. The next time the same referee refereed the same team, there were minor problems, the team complained to staff about the bad referee. The next time no problems, and now several games later, this team thinks this is the best referee they have seen.

On the other hand…

A referee does a known problem night at a facility, the first time the feedback is that this is the best referee we have seen, the next time, this is great keep sending this guy – a few weeks later? This is the worst referee, get him out of here.

In neither case (and these examples have happened multiple times across multiple facilities) did the referee change, and we seriously doubt that how the referee called the games significantly changed, the opponents changed , some of the players changed, etc. In none of these cases did we receive any actual written reports that we could follow up on. We don’t think the referee was the problem or the solution in these cases, we can change the referee, but that doesn’t change anything, the new referee will be good or bad as long as the players are just passing along their comments to staff. Referee feedback good or bad must be in writing through our website www.NWISR.com.

A couple of rules really seem to trip up players and here are some examples relating to them.

One is deliberate handling or what we usually call “handball” in the words of one (now deceased) local FIFA Referee and instructor (and coach) when he was training referees he would say “If you NEVER call handball you’ll be more right than wrong” what he was getting at is that most of the time when the ball hits a player’s hand or arm it is not deliberate and/or does not result in an advantage to the player or their team -in this instance we would say that the that the ball touched the hand rather than vice versa, or we might say it was unintentional or “trifling”  another term you might hear is that the arm is or is not in a “natural position.” Players who watch high-level games think that pretty much every time the ball hits the hand or arm it should be called, but in fact, in lower level games it almost never should be called unless the player really works at it. Here is how one referee describes his experience:

“When we’d play soccer in gym class and the recreational soccer program where I grew up –

One thing I took away from that experience was the belief that no matter what you did, never, ever let the ball touch your hands or arms as if was poison. The concept of deliberateness didn’t exist; what did exist was the idea that the most foul thing you could do in soccer was allow the ball and the hand/arm to come in contact. When I took the referee course, it was a very eye-opening experience.” Reinforcing the difference in understanding between referees and players.

“Intentional” entered the Laws in 1893. Prior to that any ball to hand contact was sanctionable.

Also in 1893 the concept of “in the opinion of the referee” was introduced, virtually all the rules are: If, in the opinion of the referee – which really means that in that game, on that field the referees opinion is fact.

Another area of misinformation is soccer announcers on TV – we referees often have a good laugh (and occasionally cry) when the former player/talking head who has never taken as much as an entry level referee course tries to explain the intricacies of a complex rule – a minor exception to this rule is Rob Stone who, on a dare from a referee, did take an introductory course and officiated a few games, he tends to be better than most – but we think most referees would agree with this high-level referee: “ I find most of the commentary and opinions expressed by announcers to  be nonsense and based on (a)  ignorance of the laws and their nuances and  (b) the lack of knowledge of the art of refereeing soccer.   And, IMO, “handball” is the most misunderstood foul.”   We would add offside if we were taking about outdoor.

Another rule that seems extremely misunderstood by players is “slide tackling”; as referees we evaluate first – did the player slide tackle? – that is, did they slide in an attempt to dispossess an opponent of the ball (Slide +Tackle) if in the opinion of the referee a player (not a goalie starting to slide in their own penalty arch) slide tackles then a slide tackle should be called (and depending on a couple of other factors a blue card should be shown and a 2 minute penalty given, or a yellow card or a red card), but what if the player is just sliding to control a ball, or to score a goal? In those cases we as referees have to judge: did the slide create a dangerous play? If no player is near or the player did not endanger anyone in the opinion of the referee, the play is not illegal. We as referees often hear “you can’t play on the ground”, sometimes we even say it, it’s convenient shorthand, but it’s not true – what is always illegal is that something the referee deems to be a slide tackle or something the referee deems to be dangerous play – referees can and should understand the distinction, players generally do not.  We could go on-and-on, but you get the point.

The points to remember:

Referees are independent contractors, they have training & experience that players do not have. They are provided through the Northwest Indoor Soccer Referees and paid by the teams, the facility has no relationship with and no supervision of any referee when acting as a referee (even if, at other times they happen to be an employee of the facility).
If any person wants to comment about the referee –good or bad. They should be directed to the website www.NWISR.com
I am either not a referee and therefore not qualified to discuss the merits or lack thereof of a referee, or I am a referee and therefore bound by my code of conduct to not discuss the merits or lack thereof of a referee other than myself. In any case, the only way to provide feedback about any referee is the website www.NWISR.com
Any player who is complaining about the referee, and remember that’s how most of us became referees, we thought we could do a better job, are encouraged to take an introductory course and find out what it’s like.



Discipline & Appeals Policy

Discipline & Appeals

One of the services we offer our member leagues, tournaments and facilities is assistance with discipline and appeals.

Even for clients who are not USSF affiliated when we handle discipline we generally follow USSF guidelines, however for non-affiliated entities the main difference is that there is no higher level of appeal, once an appeal has been heard that decision is final. The appeal path for USSF games is OASA (for games in Oregon) and then to USSF, any hearing decision letter will note appeal rights (if any), timelines and fees.

Discipline:

At the average amateur soccer game the only neutral parties are the referee(s) and facility staff, therefore whenever those people report misconduct it is generally taken as fact (the only exception is when during a hearing they recant their report). When a misconduct report is received we initiate a process that may include as little as reading the referee report and issuing a suspension, it may include a bit more “investigation” such as speaking to managers, player(s), witnesses, etc. but within 48 hours we issue a ruling, depending on the entity (league, tournament or facility) this may take the form of a Suspension or a recommendation – in cases where we make a recommendation it is completely up to the facility if or how they want to implement the suspension.

Appeals:

Some entries, including ALL USSF affiliated ones allow appeals. Once the player, coach or other affected person is notified of their suspension they may appeal by paying the appeal fee (currently $75) and requesting a hearing. Check or Money order should be made out to: Metro PDX Soccer, LLC 2169 SE Scott Ave.  Gresham Oregon 97080. MUST BE POSTMARKED WITHIN 72 HOURS OF RECIPT OF NOTICE OR APPEAL WILL BE DENIED (If appeal is denied for failure to meet deadline, check will be returned uncashed, in all other circumstances, check will be cashed)

The letter accompanying the check should note the reasons for the appeal, citing the policy, rule, law, etc. that the appellant believes has been misapplied, and should include as much detail as possible as to what the appeal is about, the name of potential witnesses, etc. Note: this is NOT the venue to complain about a referee, if a party wishes to do that they should use our online system Metro PDX Soccer Referee Complaint

Once the letter of appeal has been received  and the check clears the banking system we will appoint a committee chair who is not related to or close friends with any of the parties. The chair may request additional information from any of the parties and will attempt to set a hearing.

Please note: The hearing panel can, overturn, decrease or INCREASE any penalty previously imposed based on the evidence at the hearing.

Complain about a Referee

If you want to compliment or complain about a referee – here is how to do it.

Referees at these facility are independent contractors, they have training & experience that players do not have. They are provided through the Northwest Indoor Soccer Referees (NWISR) and paid by the teams, the facility has no relationship with and no direct supervision of any referee when acting as a referee (even if, at other times they happen to be an employee of the facility).
If you want to compliment or complain about a referee NWISR.com provides two forms for game participants to let us know how you think a referee did on a game.
#1 is our “Rant or Rave” Form – this form is for venting your feelings and/or celebrating – it is informal in nature and carries NO official weight, it will go into a referee’s file and can be filled out anytime you want to quickly comment on a referee. It has few required questions.  No action will take place.

#2 is our more Formal Feedback form – this goes into a referee’s file and is thoroughly reviewed by NWISR.com We appreciate the thoughtful feedback and ask that you wait at least 24 hours following the game and read the information below. So you can give us the best possible feedback. It has many required questions. Action may take place if warranted.

NWISR – Referee Feedback Form

General guidelines:
• The primary purpose of performing referee feedback/ evaluations is to help the referee improve as an official.
• When providing an evaluation it is imperative to base your evaluation on the referee’s performance throughout the game. If you think the referee missed a call or two, note that, but realize the referee overall did a good job – tells us about the missed call(s), but also rate the entire game.
• If you think the referee was biased against one team or certain players or behaved in an unprofessional manner please be as specific as possible with details and witnesses names.
• No referee is all good or all bad, be fair in your evaluation – if you liked the referee the last time you had them on your game, what was different about this game?
• Even the worst referee, on their worst day is more than 90% right, focus for a minute on what happened to make you think this referee did a poor job and how you would help them do better.

• If you think the referee misapplied a rule, Law or policy please be as specific as possible about what was missed. For instance a statement like “This referee doesn’t understand handball” is much less instructive than something like “The referee called handball every time the ball touched a players hand and in my opinion would have better served the game by calling fewer” Please limit comments to specific rules interpretations and actions, not a general commentary on the correctness of judgment calls.

• Often when we review feedback we get comments such as “The referee lost control of the game” when we check into it, sometimes this means the referee did not call enough fouls, or sometimes means the referee called too much and the players got frustrated. So much better to tell us “I got kicked and the referee didn’t call it, then I kicked they guy back and got a penalty, that’s not fair”
• Any player, who is complaining about the referee, should know, that’s how most of us became referees, we thought we could do a better job, you are encouraged to take an introductory course and find out what it’s really like.

If you are filling out this form because you were frustrated or disappointed with a referee, we ask that you please wait at least 24 hours after your game to fill out the form, to give yourself time to reflect upon the events of the game. Please be complete in your submissions.

Indoor Referee Continuing Education Program

Each seasonal year (November 1 – October 31) referees are required to complete a minimum of three (3) assessments (see: http://metropdxsoccer.com/assessments/ for details) conducted by three different assessors.

Additionally you must also complete 10 hours of continuing education. Below is the schedule for this seasonal year:

 Month   Date  Start Time  Finish Time   Location  Class #



You can also receive credit for other continuing education if it is focused on relevant indoor soccer topics. You must receive prior approval in order for it to count towards your indoor re-certification.

Do not wait until the last minute. These these requirements should be completed as soon as possible.

If you have any questions please call me at (503) 662-8182.




Assessments

Assessments

Each indoor referee is required to have three assessments each year each conducted by three different evaluators. The game fee is paid to the assessor.

Referees are graded from 1 (unacceptable) to 5 (Outstanding) in the following areas:

Application of Rules/ Facility Criteria
Game Control
Positioning Fitness/Work Rate
Alertness/Awareness
Communication
Advantage/Penalty
For more detail see:

To schedule assessments please contact me with your schedule and I will assist you in the process.  This may mean that you go to a facility and referee either the first or last game in a block while the referee scheduled for that game assesses, or it may mean that an assessor happens to be refereeing a block before your block or afterwards and can stay and assess you.

Why Outdoor Referees Choose Metro 7v7?

Having extensive experience with soccer and assigning, Eric Beck and Metro PDX is able to offer a full range of services depending on the desire and budget of the league or tournament. Scheduling a full range of men’s, women’s, coed and youth games is available.

Well over 95% of positions are filled as requested for each of Metro PDX’s assignments for leagues, tournaments and indoor centers. Although there are always a few exceptions (car breakdown, family emergencies, etc.), all games occur as scheduled. As Eric has worked with high profile assignors, he has the experience to offer services that go beyond many high volume assignors.  Metro PDX is honored and grateful to be able to provide this level of service.

Metro PDX does not charge any fee to the referee, a practice that Eric believes is unfair.

By working through SportZing, Metro PDX has the ability to offer a full-service website that can provide everything needed to run a league, team schedules, team payments, standings, reports, and referee reports. Sportzing is utilized with rave reviews by leagues, tournaments and indoor centers.

Eric is USSF trained and licensed as Referee Instructor, Assessor, Assignor, and Assignor Instructor. These credentials set him apart from most assignors allowing him to pursue services with excellence. Eric can take a group of people, train them to be referees, assign them to games, mentor them, assess them, and then train them to be assignors. Because of his international and professional experience, as well as his position as the Region IV (Western US) Referee Coordinator, he has extensive contacts with referees and administrators around the country and around the world. He often utilizes these connections to help organize clinics for referees.

Good-Bad-Ugly Gallery

Welcome to the  Good-Bad-Ugly Gallery!
https://picasaweb.google.com/111052669256636607197/GoodBadUgly

Starting weekly in the very near future, I will be visiting the Indoor facilities and taking pictures of games and referees in action. The gallery will be called The Good-Bad-Ugly. You decide!!

Referees distinguish themselves by the uniform they wear. You must wear a referee shirt with the BADGE I’ve provided you. Red, Yellow, and Blue cards are part of your uniform as well and you are expected to use them as needed. Northwest Indoor Badges are available for $3.00 each or 2 for $5.00.

If you’re cold, wear an extra layer or two under your referee shirt. You can also wear black warm-ups if you’d prefer not to wear shorts. Black or mostly black shoes and referee socks are also part of the uniform. You can wear a black knit cap and/or black gloves if you find you’re still chilly. If you are not able to wear a proper uniform and it comes to my attention, you will no longer receive assignments.
