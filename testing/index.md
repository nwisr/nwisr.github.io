## Referee Testing

All referees must complete online tests before receiving new or renewed referee certifications. These are open book, you can use any information you have available to you. The idea is to get you to think about the rules and the correct answers. For several of our referees English is not you first language, and if you need assistance, you can ask me or anyone else for help.

Once you start the Indoor test, you will have 4 hours to complete it.If you complete the test and pass (80% or better) you will be emailed a certificate. If you fail at this time there will be NO retake, once again these are open book, you can ask me or anyone else for help with any of the tests. You will have 30 days to complete a test.
