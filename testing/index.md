## Referee Testing

All referees must complete online tests before receiving new or renewed referee certification These are open book, you can use any information you have available to you, the idea is to get you to think about the rules and the correct answer. For several of our referees English is not you first language, and if you need assistance, you can ask me or anyone else for help.  

Once you start a test, you will have 30 days to complete the test.You will need to create a login to save and return to the test.  If you complete the test and pass (80% or better) you will be emailed a certificate. If you fail you can try again, but if you finalize and complete two trys and fail both it will cost you $5 for a third attempt â€“again, these are open book, you can ask me or anyone else for help with the test, The time limit is a 30 day period to complete the test and when you submit the first time it tells you what you got wrong, nobody should need more that two attempts.
