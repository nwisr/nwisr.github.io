## Referee Testing

All referees must complete online tests before receiving new or renewed referee certifications. These are open book, you can use any information you have available to you. The idea is to get you to think about the rules and the correct answers. For several of our referees English is not you first language, and if you need assistance, you can ask me or anyone else for help.

Once you start a test, you will have 30 days to complete it.  You will need to create a login and password to save and return to the test. If you complete the test and pass (80% or better) you will be emailed a certificate. If you fail you can try again, but if you finalize and complete two try's and fail both it will cost you $5 (my cost) for a third attempt â€“ again, these are open book, you can ask me or anyone else for help with any of the tests. You will have 30 days to complete a test.) When you submit your completed test for the first time it will inform you of any incorrect answers. Referees shouldn't need more than two attempts for a passing score.
