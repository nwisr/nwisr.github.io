## Rule 9 - {{ page.title }}

In ALL divisions, a ball kicked directly (but not deflected) into the ceiling will result in a Blue Card Penalty being assessed to the player who kicked the ball into the ceiling. If the ball is kicked by a goalkeeper, the keeper MUST serve the penalty--a designated player MAY NOT be chosen. A field player will assume the keeper’s role while the penalty is being served; this temporary keeper does not have to put on a contrasting uniform while serving as keeper.

Coed Divisions 2 and 3, Coed Over-30: Male players are limited to two goals. Women’s Beginner Leagues: All players are limited to two goals.

In all divisions, a difference of more than 10 goals is not to be displayed on the scoreboard.

Players may not pick up more than two games in which they are not a member of the playing roster in any one day. Teams may not pick up more than two non-rostered substitutes for a game. Referees may waive these substitution rules at their discretion; the rules are designed to keep a balance between teams, particularly at the lower coed levels.
