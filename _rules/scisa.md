## Rule 9 - {{ page.title }}
Coed Divisions 2 and 3, Coed Over-30: Male players are limited to two goals. Womenâ€™s Beginner Leagues: All players are limited to two goals.

In all divisions, a difference of more than 10 goals is not to be displayed on the scoreboard.

Players may not pick up more than two games in which they are not a member of the playing roster in any one day. Teams may not pick up more than two non-rostered substitutes for a game. Referees may waive these substitution rules at their discretion; the rules are designed to keep a balance between teams, particularly at the lower coed levels.
