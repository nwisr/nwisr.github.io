## Rule 9 - {{ page.title }}

Team sizes:

* U-9 through U-11: 7 players
* U-13 through Adults: 6 players
* Coed: 7 players

Saturday Night Coed Rule: Any ball which crosses TWO lines in the air, instead of three, will result in the offending team losing possession, and the opponents being awarded a free kick at the first of the two lines that was crossed.

Youth Games Scoring Differential Rule: If a team is AHEAD by three or more goals, that team is to REMOVE one player from the field. The team will continue to play one player short until the opponents are within one goal, at which time the player can be returned to the field. In youth coed games, girls’ goals are worth two points, boys’ are worth one point, and boys are limited to a total of three goals.
