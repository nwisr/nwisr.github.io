## Rule 9 - {{ page.title }}

Due to size, games at Troutdale Indoor have four field players, instead of the standard five. Coed games have a minimum of two female players if there are four field players.

In womenâ€™s and coed games, a team leading by four or more goals will not be permitted to have more than two players in the attacking (offensive) third of the field, unless the team that is behind agrees to waive this rule. Premier divisions are exempt from this rule.

All games at Troutdale Indoor have 20 minute halves, instead of the standard 22.
